# Place trades through your online broker via simple API calls

Nobody likes losing money in the market. Investors want to be informed at all times of the current state of the market, and need to be ready to make trades at a momentâ€™s notice. Imagine that you are a financial institution that wants to provide its client base with the capability to trade stocks, exchange-traded funds, and currencies, without having the need to leave their platform and manage relationships with external brokerage firms. To achieve this, you would need a way to securely integrate with online brokers for your users and allow them to make trades directly with their connected accounts seamlessly. Trade.it enables these capabilities that by providing the API infrastructure that links retail investors and financial institutions with online financial brokers.

In this code pattern, we will create a web application built on Node.Js which integrates with the [TradeIt](https://www.trade.it/) APIs to provide users an end-to-end way of making trades, buying or selling securities, against a mock brokerage. The application showcases the workflow of a customer authenticating themselves against this mock broker, and place trades through them securely. After selecting their options for the trade, the user is returned a summary of a trade ticket to review, and receives the order number and confirmation of the trade.

This code pattern is for developers looking to start building applications with TradeIt integration. When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a Node.js web application integrated with the [Trade.it](https://www.trade.it/) SDK 
* Store user authentication sessions to allow for multiple trades while signed in. 
* Issue multiple trades based on Portfolio Optimization results 

# Architecture Flow

![Architecture Flow](docs/doc-images/arch-flow.png?raw=true)

1. The user enters the webapp and selects a broker from the available integrations.
1. The user enters their credentials to link with the broker.
1. The user selects their account for transactions and proceeds to the trading ticket. They fill information regarding the trade to be made like the Ticker Name, stock quantity, and whether the trade is a buy or a sell.
1. They review the details of the trade and confirm the trade.
1. The trade details are sent to the broker and a confirmation code is returned to the user.
1. The user can proceed to make another trade which takes them back to the trading ticket.
1. They can securely log out of their session with the broker and go back to the homepage.

# Included Components

+ [TradeIt](https://www.trade.it/) The API infrastructure that links retail investors and app developers with any online financial broker
+ [Investment Portfolio](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/investment-portfolio) The Investment Portfolio service lets you store, update, and query your investment portfolios and associated holdings using flexible object definitions
> The Investment Portfolio service is available for free on [IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net)

## Featured Technologies

* [Nodejs](https://www.nodejs.org/): Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side
* [JQuery](https://www.jquery.com): jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML

# Running the Application

## Manually deploy to local machine
1. [Setup your machine](#1-setup-your-machine)
2. [Clone the repository](#2-clone-the-repository)
3. [Create Investment Portfolio service](#3-create-investment-portfolio-service)
4. [Configure .env file](#4-configure-env-file)
5. [Create TradeIt service](#5-create-tradeit-service)
6. [Run Application with NPM](#6-run-application-with-npm)

### 1. Setup your machine

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  (v5.x)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 8.9 or higher - note version 9 is not supported)
* to install specific Node version you can use [nvm](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/installing-prereqs.html)

  Example:
  + 1. `nvm install --lts`
  + 2. `nvm use --lts`
  + 3. Output `Now using node v8.11.3 (npm v5.6.0)`

### 2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ash7594/NodeSampleApp.git
```

## 3. Create Investment Portfolio service

Create the following services in IBM Cloud. This services is part of `Free` plan.

* [**Investment Portfolio**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/investment-portfolio)


## 4. Configure .env file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your clone of the project repository by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command in terminal:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

> Most files systems regard files with a "." at the front as hidden files.  If you are on a Windows system, you should be able to use either [GitBash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or [Xcopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/xcopy)

You will need to update the credentials with the IBM Cloud credentials for the services you created in [Step 2](#2-create-investment-portfolio-service).

The `.env` file will look something like the following:

```none
# Investment Portfolio
CRED_PORTFOLIO_USERID_W=
CRED_PORTFOLIO_PWD_W=
CRED_PORTFOLIO_USERID_R=
CRED_PORTFOLIO_PWD_R=

```

### 5. Create TradeIt Service

Go to [TradeIt website](https://www.trade.it/) and create an account with them.

Take note of the API Key and Base URL for your account and modify the same in the codebase.

### 6. Run Application with NPM

```
$ npm install --save
$ npm start
```

Access the running app in a browser at <http://0.0.0.0:8080/>
